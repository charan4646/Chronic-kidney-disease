Explanation:

Load your CKD dataset (replace 'your_dataset.csv' with your actual data file).
Split the data into features (X) and labels (y).
Standardize the features (optional but recommended).
Create a Decision Tree classifier.
Train the model using the training data.
Make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and generate a classification report.
Remember to preprocess your data, handle missing values, and fine-tune hyperparameters for better results. Additionally, consider exploring other algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines for comparison.
